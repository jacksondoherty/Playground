Playground.  A sandbox game for the HTC Vive (in development).

When two or more players enter a "playground", they will enter a virtual 
environment equipped with menus with which they can pull out items made
by third-party developers. Items submitted will need to pass certain 
standards such that they are able to interact with each other in interesting
ways.  For example, if one player pulls out a dragon, another player could
pull out a laser and shoot the dragon.
